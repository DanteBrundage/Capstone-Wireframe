						<h2>How Can We Prevent Further Degradation of Our Coral Reefs and Climate Change as a Whole</h2>
						<p>Written by Dante Brundage</p>
					</header>
					<h3> <center>Why should you Care?</center> </h3>

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Even though climate change is still being denied, it is affecting the ecosystems we depend on nonetheless. The amazon is burning, our air is choking, and coral reefs are dying. All of the things just stated our instrumental to our current and future survival as rapidly increasing species; However, of the three just stated, coral reefs have the biggest immediate impact on humans environmentally, economically, and culturally.</p>

					</div>
					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">As of 2018, the Great Barrier Reef lost the ability to recover from coral bleaching, which causes massive amounts of coral to expel the nutrients that sustain and give coral color, ultimately leading to their untimely deaths. This is occurring because of heightened ocean acidity levels, a direct result of abundant warm plastics in our oceans. Coral bleaching has lead to loss of coral biodiversity as well as extreme loss in global marine biodiversity. The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s 7th natural wonder, because it houses billions of species that live within our oceans. This loss in biodiversity has made local fishing harder, tourism rates drop, and ultimately damaged the global economy due to the hundreds of billions of revenue generated through a plethora of means connected to the Great Barrier Reef. Thus, it is in the world’s best interest to resolve our current degrading habits, and focus our research on how to resolve the environmental damage that has been done.
					</p>

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Because humans are dependant on dying coral reefs as a natural resource, we must take action to learn how to save them. Damage has been done, and it will take time to fix it. But must action must begin now! If we do not, humans across the world will be severely impacted one way or another. Thus, it is imperative we research and implement solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change on corals. From my recent findings I have found that the most effective courses of action to mitigate further coral degradation is through further research on how to strengthen the resilience of corals, educating the masses on general climate change and how to take action, as well as creating definitive legislation to enforce green policies. </p>

					<h3> <center>Context</center> </h3>

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> According to Salvatore Cardoni of the ABC News Network,  the most applicable of the five top pieces of environmental legislation is the Endangered Species Act and the Montreal Protocol. The Endangered Species Act was signed by Richard Nixon in 1973, and this ultimately makes sure that “no species on the list has gone extinct after being listed”. This is great because it shows that we can get serious about green action, and create definitive action on protecting species. The Montreal Protocol was an act in which we prevent 11 Billion tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere. We literally resolved a whole in our atmosphere, with this strong political action we can definitely take action to prevent and resolve degradation of coral reefs from Climate Change. National Geographic reiterates the urgency of the situation we are in around the world. The Great Barrier Reef has taken so much damage that even though Australian scientists were reluctant to do so, they are now involving themselves with the ecology of the reef since it no longer has the capability to recover on its own. Scientists have experimented with inserting baby coral with high tolerance to salinity into the reefs, and are still awaiting the results. This is helpful because this is a solution scientists are testing out to help reefs recover from the effects of climate change. This information can be incorporated into a solution such that the nation can take political action to combat the imbalances of coral ecosystems. The Guardian starts off by reflecting on how the New Green Deal started, and where it is heading. It mentions that the New Green Deal was picked up by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, and is now up for topic at the 2019 democratic debates. But this article than narrows its focus on how democratic nominees have been debating different tactics to effectively take action on climate change in an economically forgiving and rampant manner.

					<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> According to The Guardian, Bernie Sanders wants to spend 16.3 trillion dollars, and that he will get it through the jobs formed in his plan. According to Queensland Museum in Australia, on the forefront of research being done regarding climate change reversal, and the current effects of climate change on the animals within the degrading corals. This article not only states how biodiversity is degrading, but why biodiversity is important. Biodiversity not only allows for bigger fish population, but actually increases the survival options for distressed fish within collapsing ecosystems. If Biodiversity degrades, we lose key links within ecosystems structure, causing it to fail as a whole from oversaturation of predators, or other unforeseen consequences. The Washington Post begins by urging people to think considerably about their legacy. Although 63% of Americans believe in climate change, only 47% of the people think that the government should do something about it. This incorency is referred to as the “attitude-behavior” gap. The article suggest the attitude behaviour gap can be resolved through people being prompted to think about their self-interest, while appealing to their better nature. In studies where people were asked to think about what they want to be remembered for and have accomplished, many thought of family. When next prompted to take action in environmental action many were more proactive as compared to before thinking about their legacy. This is helpful because now we can think about how we can get America to question its own legacy, what we as “leaders of the western world” are to be remembered for. The Odyssey claims we should care about our coral reefs firstly because they have extreme biodiversity. Even though they only cover 1% of the ocean, they account for over 2 million species in the ocean. Secondly, coral reefs are used places to fish for popular commercial food. Thirdly, coral reefs are a major tourists destination. The Great Barrier Reef produces over an annual 375 billion dollars a year on tourism, greatly impacting the world economy. Lastly, reefs protect settlements along the coast from natural dangers, they are in a sense a first form of defense. This article is helpful because although short it provides me with good statistics for biodiversity and economic relevance of reefs.

				<h3> <center>Findings</center> </h3>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> My first solution is to create impactful legislation which will increase protective action of the coral reefs, and human’s negligent degradation of the planet as a whole. The best example I have found so far is the creation of the Coral Reef Task  Force(USCRTF) formed in 1998 by presidential executive order 13089 as to create efforts to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. The Coral Reef Task Force consists of 12 leaders of different federal agencies which includes the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.), seven U.S. states, territories, commonwealths, and three freely associated states, and serves to build partnerships, strategies, and support for on-the-ground action to protect coral reefs.
				</p>

				</div>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> This is a great step in the right direction because this group has been able to create public plans and policies which all their members must follow if need be. To name a few, the USCRTF Watershed Partnership Initiative Priority Ecosystem Indicators, and the Handbook on Coral Reef Impacts: Avoidance, Minimization, Compensatory Mitigation, and Restoration. According to the EPA the Watershed Partnership Initiative “provides coastal managers coral reef managers, and watershed coordinators faced with modest budgets a suite of recommended ecological indicators and measurements to include in their watershed-specific monitoring plans. The recommended ecological indicators and measurements help determine the efficacy and evaluate the success of management efforts to reduce land-based sources of pollution on coral reef ecosystems.” This is a great example of how through political alliances, not even through legislation, organizations who are willing can take effective measures, because it eliminates the premise of big companies near coral reefs not knowing how their pollutants will affect their surrounding environments. The E.P.A. also explains the USCRTF’s handbook will “provide a review of the federal authorities, existing policies, and federal, state, and territory roles and responsibilities; a compendium of current best practices—science-based methodologies for quantifying ecosystem functions or services; and a general overview of basic protocols available for use when assessing impacts to coral reef ecosystems and mitigating or restoring for unavoidable impacts to coral reef ecosystems, including the use of appropriate compensatory action to replace the lost functions and services.” In all, this handbook is excellent because it creates a means for the USCRTF’s members to be proactive in the fight for our planet’s suitable condition.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">However, a major flaw with the USCRTF is though they are creating good policies, they have little to know means of holding entities responsible, if at all, for their actions. Because the USCRTF creates things such as handbooks and alliances, they can only hold a select few responsible, and there are no clear repercussions if members violate suggested guidelines of the USCRTF. Also, the number of members of the USCRTF are limited. For example, the USCRTF only has seven states partnered with it. Thus, only 14% of our country is allegedly on board with protecting our coral reefs. Even though not all our states are near coral reefs, almost all of the oil pipelines that run through our country eventually run near the Gulf of Mexico. The level of strict management and maintenance of pipelines, a major potential pollutant, falls in the hands of each state and the policing of that states companies. Thus, the lack of enforcement and support of the USCRTF policies become a concern. At the end of the day, agreements and plans without accountability and commitment is useless conjecture.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Hope is not lost yet. Innovative proposed plans such as the New Green Deal have the opportunity to hold big companies and politicians accountable for their degradation of our environment. If the New Green Deal is initiated after the 2020 presidential elections, we may just achieve a cleaner and more efficient future.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">The second solution I found myself upon is humans involvement in the survival of coral reef ecosystems. Previously mentioned, because of extreme conditions in our oceans, the Great Barrier Reef, and presumably others, have lost the ability to bounce back from their losses due to the mass scale of repeated loss. Thus, new research has been conducted as a means to aid the endurance of our reefs for the future, because frankly the long term effects of our present actions will continue to harshen the environment of the reefs. According to the National Geographic, last year Australian scientist transplanted hundreds of nursery grown coral fragments onto the distraught Great Barrier Reef. This process is not new and has been carried out for decades, but what makes this specific transplantation significance is that it had to be done to the biggest reef in the world. Because of the coral reefs size, a speedy recovery should not be a problem for it, but now it is. Thus, though the implanting of corals can serve an environmental impact, it is ultimately a band-aid solution. We need to get to the root cause of corals harshening environments, heat waves that are causing coral “bleaching”, which are occurring because of the planets absurdly swift changes in temperature and weather changes.
				</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">My third solution is to increase environmental education with the goal of bringing attention to climate change, but through an approach that instills optimism and encouragement to change our actions. Environmental action is not supported by a significant amount of Americans because they are not well educated, or are given information that misconstrues the current climate crisis as subjective. And even where they are informed of the current climate crisis, ultimately many individuals are left feeling powerless. According to Joseph Senn, AP Environmental Science teacher at Oakland Technical High School, “Education is a solution to all environmental problems. If you don’t know there is a crisis or problem, you’re not gonna do anything about it, or you might be counteractive.” This sentiment is very powerful because knowledge is considered power, thus if people are properly educated on climate change and how specifically the degradation of coral reefs is occurring, they will be empowered to take action however they can. This is proven evident through individuals taking action in their everyday to do their part. For example, “there is research showing that people are willing to spend more money just for the peace of mind of knowing that what their actions do don’t have negative consequences”. This exemplifies ways in which people act when they are educated and empowered, and have a clear sense of how to support green initiatives.

					</div>
				However, Mr.Senn stated “People are comfortable with what they have [...] so by engaging in other thoughts or other points of view that requires energy, and that’s difficult.” This rings true, but is frustrating because someone can only be taught if they want to, the same way someone will receive help if they want the help. People across the world debate climate change, but most of these nay-sayers are in first world countries that do not feel the first hand effects of climate change. Thus, because they are in a bubble, they do not feel the need to educate themselves on a point of view that feels subjective.

				<h3> <center>Conclusion</center> </h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Ultimately, it is vital that we take immediate action to resolve our climate issues at hand, while encouraging more people to aid the cause through education. Climate change will significantly impact everyone one way or another, but we are at the precipice of no return. As of recent, we have seen an impact to our coral reefs, and through current scientific efforts we are attempting to prevent the damage that is being done. But we must stop the damage as a whole. It is important to be educated on our issues, but we must also stay up to date on new solutions. With this will come the intelligence and optimism to effectively do our part independently, economically, or through legislation.
